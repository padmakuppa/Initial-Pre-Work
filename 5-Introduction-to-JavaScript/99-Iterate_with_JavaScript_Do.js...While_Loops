//I learned about iterating with a DO-WHILE loop. Unlike WHILE loop, DO-WHILE loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once before the specified condition check.
// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

  do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
