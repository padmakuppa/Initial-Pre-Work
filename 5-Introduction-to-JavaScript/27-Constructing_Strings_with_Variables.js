//I learned how to construct a string with variables by inserting them using a + operator.
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "bubsy";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am wll!";
